        <h2>Vegetarian Lasagna</h2>
        <p>The very best Vegetarian Lasagna! Walnuts, zucchini, carrots, onions, and mushrooms blitzed up into a meat-like texture that gets layered with lots of cheese and sauce. Cozy + nourishing!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 onion, peel and cut into chunks</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 cup of fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 cup of walnuts</li>
            <li>1 small zucchini, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter or olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1-3 teaspoons of kosher salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>3 cups of tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup of mascarpone</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, grated</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>2 cups of parmesean, shredded</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups of mozzerella, shredded</li>
            <li>1 box of lasanga noodles</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the mushrooms, walnuts, and zucchini in a food processor. Pulse a few times until the mixture is very finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat this process with garlic, onion, and carrots.</li>
            <li>Heat butter or olive oil over medium high heat. Add your chopped veggies along with the spices. Sauté for 7-10 minutes until very soft and fragrant. Add tomato sauce and salt; stir to combine. Taste and adjust! Your seasoning amounts will depend on your brand of sauce.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Mix mascarpone cheese with grated garlic and salt. </li>
            <li>Start with spreading a layer of sauce in the bottom of a 9×13 pan. Then, layer in the following order for each layer: a few noodles, 1 cup sauce, a few dollops of mascarpone, 1/2 cup Parmesan, 1/2 cup mozzarella, and repeat (I usually get 4 layers out of this amount). End with noodles, sauce, cheese, and dollops of extra sauce on top to make it pretty.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for 40-45 minutes. Remove foil and broil for 5 minutes to get the cheese browned on top. Let stand for 10 minutes or so, then cut and serve!</li>
        </ol>
