        <h2>Panzanella Panini</h2>
        <p>I made this sandwich by combining my 2 favorite sandwiches, and salad, together. The result was delicious!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 French deli roll, split</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 slices mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 small tomato, sliced </li>
            <li>4 fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle cut sides of roll with balsamic vinegar. Layer one slice of mozzarella cheese, tomato slices, basil leaves, and the remaining slice of mozzarella cheese on the roll. Close sandwich; rub outside with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Place sandwich in preheated skillet; top with another heavy skillet to press. Cook until bread is toasted and golden, about 3 minutes. Flip sandwich; top with skillet. Cook second side until toasted, about an additional 2 minutes.</li>
